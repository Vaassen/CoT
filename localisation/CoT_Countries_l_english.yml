 V03_1:0 "House Blacktower"
 V03_1_desc:0 "The Blacktower dynasty once again rules the Vertesk Dominion after decades among the minor nobility. Now that glory has been regained the Blacktowers intend to fulfill the plan of Venac the Arrogant, the founder of the Dynasty, and establish themselves among the great families of Cannor and finally allow a strictly human dynasty to compete with the silver families."
 V03_2:0 "Venac's Reforms"
 V03_2_desc:0 "Venac the Arrogant was the Sorcerer-King's most gifted acolyte, an outstanding strategist and leader of men. He managed the Vertesker army and turned them into disciplined and effective troops that were able to repel the army of the Free Kingdoms for years, until Venac's death. We must follow his example and learn from his genius to ensure the future of the Dominion."
 V03_3:0 "Scum & Villainy"
 V03_3_desc:0 "Unlike the other nobles of Cannor, the Vertesker nobility does not have long dynasties preceding it and does not possess all the codes of respectability of the great families. Worse still, most of them are ennobled villains. Yet they now find themselves eating at the tables of other nobles and treating them smugly,'The main difference between you and us? We are beginning our renown, you are finishing yours.'"" 
 V03_4:0 "Under the gaze of Bal Vertesk"
 V03_4_desc:0 "The huge Vertesk Ball Tower has finally been completed, having surpassed its former glory, its shadow extends over the capital of the Vertesk Dominion. Within it, the entire Vertesker surveillance system, mages, nobles, merchants, spies, all working together to ensure that nothing escapes Bal Vertesk's gaze. There must be total control, and for that, everything must be under surveillance. " 
 V03_5:0 "Worthless Auxillia"
 V03_5_desc:0 "Life has little value in the Vertesk Dominion, only the Dominion itself matters. The recruitment system of the Vertesker army is aware of this and is especially cruel:0 any man who lacks money will make a good soldier, any man in debt will make a good slave. It is on this principle that the Vertesker army finds its fighters, taking advantage of the misery of the lower castes. "
 V03_6:0 "A cruel lot"
 V03_6_desc:0 "Living in the Vertesk Dominion brings its share of horror, despite the wealth of the city, inequality reigns and for the lower castes life is especially hard. All live in contact with the slaves, in fear of becoming one themselves, and all see the violence of the Dominion system. In a city where everyone is used to violence and injustice, the horrors of war seem sadly bland and usual. "
 V03_7:0 "On a Slave's back"
 V03_7_desc:0 "The economy of the Dominion is based on slavery at all levels, the slave trade on the one hand and slave labour on the other. This easily corveable, obedient, docile and submissive workforce allowed the city to grow rapidly, attracting a great deal of wealth to it. However, today the city is dependent on slavery, its economy could not function without a massive daily influx of slaves. "

 Z46_1:0 "Land of Many rivers"
 Z46_1_desc:0 "The Esmari landscapes, crossed by numerous rivers, have made the region famous, notably through the Esmari river parties. The Esmari generals learned during the  various internal wars to use these rivers and to adapt to this especially difficult terrain, requiring complex manoeuvres during battles. The Esmari army is known as one of  the most versatile in Cannor, its soldiers and marines used to rapid deployment. "
 Z46_2:0 "United Esmari Navy"
 Z46_2_desc:0 "The Navy has always played a central role in each of the countries that make up Esmaria, each with their own specificities. Their union has only reinforced this  strength, making Esmaria a naval power that is hardly rivaled within the Anbennar Empire. Joining the Marines remains the dream of many Esmaris and ensures honour and  prestige for the brave who join them."
 Z46_3:0 "Forged by Compromise"
 Z46_3_desc:0 "Esmaria remains one of the most populated and diverse regions of the Empire, and although today its peoples proudly claim to be citizens of Esmaria, this has  not always been the case and the different cultures within it have clashed on several occasions in the past. The unification of such a diverse region has been made possible  by numerous compromises that were difficult to balance but that have proven to be effective. "
 Z46_4:0 "Reunited at last"
 Z46_4_desc:0 "The question of Esmari unity has been a complex issue for centuries, and while there is no doubt about the cultural closeness of all the peoples living in this  region, in practice reunification has been a complex matter. Esmaria is now the cultural heart of the Empire as the great project of a united Esmaria has finally been  accomplished. The prosperity of the Duchy comes without a doubt."
 Z46_5:0 "#Land of Humans, Elves, Gnomes and Dwarves"
 Z46_5_desc:0 "Many races live on the Esmaris lands, humans, gnomes, elves, dwarves... And all of them should be able to live properly and be accepted on these lands. The  Esmari leaders, in order to ensure the viability of the Duchy, agreed very quickly on the need to build this new nation on tolerance and respect for each of the races that  make it up. "
 Z46_6:0 "The All-Esmari Soldier"
 Z46_6_desc:0 "The Esmaris armies and more specifically their Marines have always had the reputation of being among the best in the Empire. The various small countries  originally had small but highly trained armies. The creation of a united Esmari has not reduced the requirements from the armed forces, on the contrary even the strategic  knowledge of the formerly independent countries has been combined, making the Esmari army a formidable army on the battlefield and its generals great strategists. The use of  the many races and their methods of combat has continued to strengthen the viability of the Esmari army. "
 Z46_7:0 "In a Rose garden under a full moon, a River flows steadily"
 Z46_7_desc:0 "The Lilac War was especially deadly for the Esmaris peoples, who were torn between, on the one hand, a majority of supporters of the Moon Party and on the other  hand, the supporters of the Pink Party, less numerous but directly supported by Lothane III. Esmari unity has had to be achieved in spite of violent memories of the past, but  the diverse ideological origins of the Esmari make them a central country in negotiations within the Empire, known for having brilliant diplomats, capable of handling the  most tense situations.

 V40_silnara_loyalty_desc:0 "House Silnara has ruled Businor for hundreds of years; and it shall rule it for hundreds of years more. As one of the Silver Families, the name Silnara is synonymous with the Businori Empire. When the men of Businor fight, they know it for this most prestigious of noble houses."
 V40_sun_sets:0 "The Sun Never Sets"
 V40_sun_sets_desc:0 "The Sun Never Sets upon the Businori Empire; this is a known fact. From Cannor to Sarhal to Haless, a part of our realm is always warmed by the sun's light. Ours is a global empire, one that we will uphold to our dying breath."
 V40_lion_armada:0 "The Lion Armada"
 V40_lion_armada_desc:0 "The Lion Armada is the very thing which keeps Businori Empire tied together. Ship after ship departs from Businor's ports, and most of them do not see its shores again until years have passed. Through the union of Busilar and Eborthíl, we have created a navy that is truly worthy of ruling the waves."
 V40_lion_heart:0 "Lion-Hearted"
 V40_lion_heart_desc:0 "Being called Lion-Hearted is the greatest of compliments that a man hailing from Businor can receive. For Lions are a symbol of bravery, strength, and honor. If Businor is to stand strong, all its people must have the hearts of lions. Whether sailor or soldier, whether commoner or noble."
 V40_birth_empire:0 "Birthplace of an Empire"
 V40_birth_empire_desc:0 "The land of Businor is the heart of the Empire by that same name. It is there, in the lands nestled between the waters of the Divenhal and the war-torn realms of Cannor, that the wealth of entire continents comes to rest. It is in Businor that great works, influenced by all manner of cultures and beliefs touched by that great empire, arise."
 V40_bypass_gold:0 "Bypass the Golden Road"
 V40_bypass_gold_desc:0 "For centuries, the Golden Road had been the only thing connecting the far-flung lands of Haless with Cannor. The masterwork of Jaher, Conqueror and Savior, it had united lands that had not ever even heard of each other. When that Golden Road had been battered by repeated conflicts and the connection to Haless severed, so too had its wealth been withheld from us. Now, however, Businor has reconnected what had once been lost: Haless, and its wealth, are once again connected to the shores of Cannor."
 V40_one_god_one_truth_one_world:0 "One God, One Truth, One World"
 V40_one_god_one_truth_one_world_desc:0 "When the elf Torrieth brought the God Fragment to Cannorian shores, she found a welcome home in the Ravelian societies dedicated to the promotion of new knowledge. But the societies soon became something new, something more, and the newborn religion of Ravelianism found one of its first true believers in the King of Busilar, Varil Silnara.\n\nUnder his reign and wisdom, the proclamations of the One God were distributed to every inhabitant of the lands, and Ravelian missionaries brought the light of artificery to even the smallest villages of the Khenak foothills. But the first two Fundamental Truths to life is that we all live in One World, and are created by One God, and so Varil did not stop there. By 1631, almost every Busilari ship engaged in the Kingdom's prodigious Sarhaly and Halessi trade would carry with it an array of new inventions along with a missionary who would use them to spread the teachings of the One God. In trading ports across Halann, in the wake of a Busilari trade fleet's visit, small communities of Ravelian adherents would undoubtedly spring up."
