Travesty was averted when the many soldiers (retired or on leave) who were recuperating at the temple took up arms against the Moon Party cowards.

 flavor_lorent.1.t:0 "The Ruby Crown Awakened"
 flavor_lorent.1.d:0 ""My [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], are you sure you want to do this?"\n"Yes."\n\nAnd that was it. The mages of the Ruby Order performed their unbinding ritual on the crown, in hopes of freeing whatever entity or spirit was trapped within it. It was said that the elf Ioriel, the founder of the House of Siloriel and Mother of Lorent bound her soul to the crown in order to guide the future of the country for the rest of time, and now, hopefully, she would be free.\n\n"The ritual is complete. Did anything happen, my [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]? Is there anything different?"\n"No. I guess it was a fable after all," you reply."
 flavor_lorent.1.a:0 "I was lying to the mage, of course. Now I am free."
 flavor_lorent.2.t:0 "Resistance to Ravelians"
 flavor_lorent.2.d:0 "The Regent Court clergy in Lencenor have long seen the Corinites as an eastern threat, just as Cannor did to the Greentide. It was, for them, a corruption of the faith. For the Lencori, faith should be an equal part of life, not something that dominates it as the self-righteous Corinites believed.\n\nIt was bad enough that the Corinites sought to redefine what they saw as just and righteous, but now the Ravelian Church, an offshoot of the Corinites, now seek to bring religion to the forefront and control all our actions, and of course, under one central authority... theirs!\n\nEven the most moderate of clerics have voiced concerns of this fundamentalist threat, and have banded together to help defend the realm from further religious upheaval."
 flavor_lorent.2.a:0 "We must survive these changing times."
 flavor_lorent.2.b:0 "If Lencenor changes, so be it."
 flavor_lorent.3.t:0 "The Shofa Protectorate"
 flavor_lorent.3.d:0 "As Lorentish ships became a common sight around Noruin, the bat-nosed elves living there became aware that not all invaders were equal; even to them, it was obvious all respected the power of those bearing the Rose.\n\nThe Shofa tribe has bent the knee to the Bone Citadel for decades, and yet with the Citadel under threat from the Onyx Legion, they feel the winds of change. They turned to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] that rules from above a bloody river instead, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] who commands the mightiest armies of the world and whose ships blot out the sun, or so they've heard, and humbly requested protection and perhaps less harsh tributes.\n\nWhile they don't have a lot to offer in exchange for our protection, some of our advisors point out it would give us a foothold right next to the rich Trollsbay, and have already nicknamed the territory Núr Ionnidar."
 flavor_lorent.3.a:0 "They shall become a protectorate under the Lorentish crown."
 flavor_lorent.3.b:0 "We have no need of such lowly barbarians."

 #COT Events
 
 flavor_lorent.4.t:0 "Overt Lorentish Diplomatic Pressure"
 flavor_lorent.4.d:0 "Lorentish diplomats arrived in the Rubyhold today with the most ludicrous proposal. Claiming fears of future invasion after the ruinous Lilac Wars, they have cordially 'invited' us to join our defenses with those of their realm. \n It is clear to the Clan Leaders that Lorent has only it's own interests in mind, and if we answer in a manner they don't approve the holds may find themselves under threat. While many younger dwarves see the lorentish concerns as valid after the Lilac Wars, some of the older dwarves view the very suggestion that we would be threatened by anyone, or subservient to Lorentish designs, to be insulting."
 flavor_lorent.4.a:0 "We cannot leave them be!"
 flavor_lorent.4.b:0 "Bah, Rubyhold are old friends, they will not threaten us."
 
 flavor_lorent.5.t:0 "Rubyhold Bows"
 flavor_lorent.5.d:0 "Under pressure of our diplomatic and military might, those stubborn Ruby Dwarves have actually agreed to bow their head and 'help guide our realm from the inside.' Whatever helps those goats sleep aside, we've a marvelous opportunity on our hands here. It is inevitable that Wesdam will not like this however, and we must stand ready for their response."
 flavor_lorent.5.a:0 "How civilized. §R This likely will lead to war with Wesdam§!"
 flavor_lorent.5.b:0 "We've actually changed Our mind."

 flavor_lorent.6.t:0 "Rubyhold Refuses"
 flavor_lorent.6.d:0 "The blockheaded dirtmongers have refused to listen to our most polite request that they join our realm. It would seem, even, that anti-Lorentish sentiment has taken hold among the dwarves and war is soon upon us."
 flavor_lorent.6.a:0 "They made the crown, but they will learn we wear it!"
 flavor_lorent.6.b:0 "We will show these fools they should've stayed in their mountain."

 flavor_lorent.7.t:0 "Tretun War for the Electorship"
 flavor_lorent.7.d:0 "Our immense diplomatic sway in the wake of the Lilac Wars, along with our unique leverage from securing the release of Tretun, has given us a great opportunity to sieze the electorship from Pearlsedge, should we desire to do so. This opportunity is fleeting, however, and we may not get another chance."
 flavor_lorent.7.a:0 "Push Tretun to attack! §GThis can lead to Vassalizing an Elector Tretun§!"
 flavor_lorent.7.b:0 "No, we cannot trust Tretun's inbred lords."

 flavor_lorent.8.t:0 "Tretun Wins the Electorship!"
 flavor_lorent.8.d:0 "Our plans have come to fruition. With the victory over the Pearlsedgers all but complete, we need only send our demands. Our keen diplomacy will soon see both Tretun, and their 
 flavor_lorent.8.a:0 "All too easy."
 
 flavor_lorent.9.t:0 "Reformation of Pearlsedge"
 flavor_lorent.9.d:0 "The Pearlsedge legacy lays unclaimed, but holds more prestige than that of Tretun's. It is time to step forward and claim this legacy for our own. No longer are we a minor pawn in the game of giants... surely!"
 flavor_lorent.9.a:0 "Hail Tretun! Hail Pearsledge!"

 flavor_lorent.10.t:0 "An Agreement with the Magisterium?"
 flavor_lorent.10.d:0 "Lorentish diplomats have come with a proposal to secure our border. They know we have little desire for the land itself, but it is well known that Lorent relies heavily upon trade which leaks from the Bay of Wines. In exchange for relinquishing all claims to our land, the Lorentish Crown asks we lower the toll and give them exclusive trade rights."
 flavor_lorent.10.a:0 "We accept, a friendly Lorent is better than a few ducats."
 flavor_lorent.10.b:0 "Commit to deals with Lorent? No, just deflect them with bureaucracy."
 flavor_lorent.10.c:0 "Decline their offer, pretty words mean nothing to us."

 flavor_lorent.11.t:0 "The Magisterium Accepts"
 flavor_lorent.11.d:0 "A deal has been struck, praise the Court! With the mages on our side and our economy secured, we have little left to fear."
 flavor_lorent.11.a:0 "These Mages are wise."

 flavor_lorent.12.t:0 "The Magisterium Deflects"
 flavor_lorent.12.d:0 "Meaningless words and empty promises met our diplommats, who returned after a week of no progress. It seems the Magisterium has not yet decided to choose sides in the Great Game. This is a minor setback to our diplomat's reputation, but at least the gifts they received hold some value."
 flavor_lorent.12.a:0 "Bureaucrats."

 flavor_lorent.13.t:0 "The Magisterium Declines"
 flavor_lorent.13.d:0 "The Mages of the Collegium have decided to outright rebuff our generous offer. It is clear that they have chosen to side against us."
 flavor_lorent.13.a:0 "Their island will burn for this."
 
 flavor_lorent.14.t:0 "A Proposal to Counter the Alenic Threat"
 flavor_lorent.14.d:0 "Long has the Alenic Frontier been a plague in the side of true Cannorians. It is time to meet with our allies to discuss a mutually secure border agreement so that we might stem the tide and focus on reclaiming our rightful spot on the Dove Throne."
 flavor_lorent.14.a:0 "Let us rally against the Alenics."
 flavor_lorent.14.b:0 "We need no help from our lessers."
 
 flavor_lorent.15.t:0 "Lorent Proposes an Alenic Deal."
 flavor_lorent.15.d:0 "Lorent has offered us a deal to mutually secure our border against the Alenic threats and the Gerudian menaces beyond. Shall we accept the offer of those uppity pricks?"
 flavor_lorent.15.a:0 "Of course, we've nothing to lose from such a deal."
 flavor_lorent.15.b:0 "Tell those narcissists we can monitor our own border just fine."
 
 flavor_lorent.16.t:0 "Alenic Border Deal Made"
 flavor_lorent.16.d:0 "The diplomat we sent with a deal to protect our northern border has returned with positive news, as if any other outcome was to be expected."
 flavor_lorent.16.a:0 "Imagine our 'ally's' relief."
 
 flavor_lorent.17.t:0 "Alenic Border Deal Denied"
 flavor_lorent.17.d:0 "It would seem our so-called Ally in the north does not truly understand the Alenic threat or our magnaminity. No matter, we need them not."
 flavor_lorent.17.a:0 "As always, we can only rely on ourselves."
 
 flavor_lorent.18.t:0 "Lorent and Eastern Anbennar"
 flavor_lorent.18.d:0 "Over the previous centuries, Lorentish influence over Anbennar has spread to a feverish height. A minor diplomat arrived today with a small token of well-being. It is clear what their intention is, all that is left to ask is... do we take the bribe?"
 flavor_lorent.18.a:0 "This is no bribe! Lorent only pursues their right."
 flavor_lorent.18.b:0 "Never serve another Rose!"
 
 flavor_lorent.19.t:0 "The Redglade Accord"
 flavor_lorent.19.d:0 "Building upon our ancient agreement with the Redglades, our advisors have presented drafts of two potential updates. One leaves the question of integration of the Redglades open, while the other wll confirm their autonomous status in perpetuity."
 flavor_lorent.19.a:0 "Our recent experience in the Lilac Wars recommends caution."
 flavor_lorent.19.b:0 "The Redglades are true, affirm their old rights."
 
 flavor_lorent.20.t:0 "The Redglade Accord"
 flavor_lorent.20.d:0 "Our Lorentish Overlord has spent the last month revamping, editting, and updating the ancient agreements they hold with us in the wake of the Lilac Wars. Until now it was unclear if they sought to reward us more rights for our loyalty, or if their fear leads them to uncertainty over our fate."
 flavor_lorent.20.a:0 "Loyalty wins out, our autonomy is upheld"
 flavor_lorent.20.b:0 "It seems fear and uncertainty reign in Lorentaine."

 flavor_lorent.21.t:0 "A Meeting with Love"
 flavor_lorent.21.d:0 "The Minaran temple sat idle for most of the Lilac War, helping wounded from both sides - something that greatly angered us Loyalists. However, in the last days of the war the Rubenaire scum tried a desperate assault on the temple to ransack it and finance their war. This was repelled by the mercenaries and ragtag band of wounded loyalist knights that were resting in the temple. This act of treachery changed the perspective of the Minarans, and sought them to reconcile with us. Now, as our relations have improved, a large contingent of these loyalist knights, kicked out from their estats by our rebellious vassals, remain at the temple aimless. The Minaran Abbess has offered the service of these knights, and of her cult, in exchange for continued goodwill."
 flavor_lorent.21.a:0 "Let us discuss more in my chambers, Abbess..."
 flavor_lorent.21.b:0 "We will retrain those knights, but nothing more."
 
 flavor_lorent.22.t:0 "Shrouded Coast Migrants"
 flavor_lorent.22.d:0 "Recent migration of some of our elven subjects to the relative solitude of the Shrouded Coast have brought to the front an issue we've contemplated long. The Crovanians are an unusual sort, but were never rebellious, simply preferring to keep to themselves. Their new innovation in the field of artillery and humble demeanor would make them a good compliment to our forces, but their is no doubt this would require investment of land, men, and matieral we could use directly."
 flavor_lorent.22.a:0 "Crovanian investment would be unwise."
 flavor_lorent.22.b:0 "Serfs that know their place should be kept and valued."
 
 flavor_lorent.23.t:0 "Repay Lorentish Debt"
 flavor_lorent.23.d:0 "The recent Lilac Wars saw great efforts by the Lorentish people. Without the crown of Lorent the rest of the Rose party would not have stood a chance, and the current state of Anbennar would not be as it is now. The time has come to repay our debts to the Ruby Throne. No doubt they seek to expand their claims into Western Anbennar... what shall our response be?"
 flavor_lorent.23.a:0 "Acknowledge Lorentish claims, but take no action."
 flavor_lorent.23.b:0 "Support our old friend in all ways!"
 flavor_lorent.23.c:0 "Oh, we'll repay those Rose dogs alright..."
 
 flavor_lorent.24.t:0 "Tretun Comes for the Electorship"
 flavor_lorent.24.d:0 "Tretun, with the backing of those pestiluent puppeteers in Lorent, has declared an unjust war to claim the electorship from us. Should we fail it is unlikely our nation will continue to exist- this is a fight for our entire way of life!"
 flavor_lorent.24.a:0 "WE RIDE TO GLORY OR DEATH! §RStay above -95% Warscore, or else§!!"
 
 flavor_lorent.25.t:0 "Rubenaire Begs Peace"
 flavor_lorent.25.d:0 "Our recent successes in the war against Rubenaire has brought them to the bargaining table early. They have a pitiful proposal, simply the release of Tretun and some money, but such a quick victory after the tragedy of the Lilac Wars will prove great for our international renown. This will also give us exceptional influence over Tretun and unique access to the Empire of Anbennar. \n §G If we accept this, it will start an event chain that can lead to transferring Pearlsedge's electorship to Tretun and us gaining a personal union over them.%§!"
 flavor_lorent.25.a:0 "An easy deal to accept."
 flavor_lorent.25.b:0 "No, we end them NOW."

 flavor_lorent.26.t:0 "Rose Elves in the Military."
 flavor_lorent.26.d:0 "What to do about the Rose Elves... By serving as drill instructors they will surely create an army worth of Lencenor. That said, they have exacting standards and some argue the Elves are best used in court."
 flavor_lorent.26.a:0 "Utilize the veteran drill instructors, whatever the hardship"
 flavor_lorent.26.b:0 "Elves have a fondness for the sea which we should leverage."
 flavor_lorent.26.c:0 "We need such valuable advisors at court, not on the field."

 flavor_lorent.27.t:0 "Lencori Sea Elves"
 flavor_lorent.27.d:0 "How shall we include the Sea Elves in our Navy?"
 flavor_lorent.27.a:0 "Use their deepwater expertise to protect our colonial ventures."
 flavor_lorent.27.b:0 "Protection of the homeland is paramount, establish a coastal guard."
 flavor_lorent.27.c:0 "They have had enough war, let them establish a merchant marine."

 flavor_lorent.28.t:0 "Darien Reforms"
 flavor_lorent.28.d:0 "Darien of Ainethan has recommended that we decentralize our military. In his system, trusted familial advisors and close friends will be trained in localized tactics of our different vassals states. This will allow for greater tactical flexibility and increase logistical capacity. Others suggest using his theories to focus on a specific facet of our army. The Elven legend Irondiel recommends we focus on our time-honored staple, Cavalry. Sir Justein of Crovan's Rest has instead proposed that we move away from antiquated concepts and embrace the new king of the battlefield - cannon. All look to you to make the final decision."
 flavor_lorent.28.a:0 "Stay true to tradition. Reform the cavalry based on Enchanted Rosemetal"
 flavor_lorent.28.b:0 "The time of cavalry charges is gone. Follow Crovan's lead - it is now the age of gunpowder."
 flavor_lorent.28.c:0 "As Darien urges, let each region pursue their specialty and focus on effective leadership."
