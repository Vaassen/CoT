 dartaxagerdim_events.1.t:0 "Ancient site Found!"
 dartaxagerdim_events.1.d:0 "After years of searching the country side and a dozen failed digs, our archaeologists have finally found what we were looking for: an ancient site that seems to be from the period of Djinn Sulatanates! What's more, while it initially seemed to be a small site, that was only the tip of a massive palace underground complex, apparently once housing hiding genies from Brasan the Emancipator and the human genie-binders he taught. Though we have only reached the precipice, our magi have started carefully dismantling the defensive magic of the place, and learning the long forgotten arts of genie magic along the way."
 dartaxagerdim_events.1.a:0 "Let's see what we've found!"
 dartaxagerdim_events.2.t:0 "Reviving the Ancient Arts"
 dartaxagerdim_events.2.d:0 "The study of magic is an investment of generations, as such it has taken years to study ancient magics. Now, after some of the best minds of our college have bent themselves over the genie artifacts, they have been able to extract some spells from their depths. These spells all seem to revolve around one specific school of magic. We have been able to learn ancient Genie secrets from the great school of..."

 dartaxagerdim_events.3.t:0 "A Faithful Decision"
 dartaxagerdim_events.3.d:0 "Once the faith was clear. Surakel had sacrificed himself for the safety of our people. But with the coming of Jaher to Brasan the priests down in Bulwar declared him to be his divine incarnation. He did well, he freed us from the gnolls and forged Bulwar into a great empire. But he died, and his successors the 'Sun' Elves have been but pale impressions of his radiance. Now there is disagreement, many say the Sun Elves now all share the spirit of Surakel. But in the far east a group of Sun Elves has started saying that it's not only Sun Elves that have to fulfill Surakel's duties but that it falls to all. However there are still those closer to home that say that Jaher was never the incarnation of Surakel and that we must still wait for the reincarnation of our Sun God. What do we believe?"
 dartaxagerdim_events.3.a:0 "Jaher was a fraud, we must wait longer still."
 dartaxagerdim_events.3.b:0 "After Jaher, Surakel's duties fall to us all."
 dartaxagerdim_events.3.c:0 "I guess the Sun Elves are the true successors?"
 dartaxagerdim_events.4.t:0 "Ziggurat of Surakel has been completed!"
 dartaxagerdim_events.4.d:0 "It has been slowly arising over the city of [Root.GetName], now finally it is complete. Thousands of masons, hundreds of sculptors, dozens of painters and metalworkers have laboured for ten years to complete this marvel of architecture. We have truly built one of the wonders of the world. Let the world see the glory of Surakel!"
 dartaxagerdim_events.4.a:0 "Praise the Sun!"
 dartaxagerdim_events.5.t:0 "An Akali for the Akal!"
 dartaxagerdim_events.5.d:0 "Dartaxes began his revolt with only his nephew as his heir. Now as the leader of a kingdom, the unmarried Akal finds himself in need of a bride, and an heir of his own to succeed should he perish."
 dartaxagerdim_events.5.a:0 "Marry the daughter of the Szal-Fazil, Kizar, a powerful mage!"
 dartaxagerdim_events.5.b:0 "Marry the daughter of Harrum, Zaina, and secure the loyalty of the Sebhuliam."
 dartaxagerdim_events.5.c:0 "Marry the nobleborn sister of Dartaxes's most trust lieutenant, Rukhiya szal-Dieshaz!"
 dartaxagerdim_events.6.t:0 "The Spear of Jaher"
 dartaxagerdim_events.6.d:0 "Taken from the Bastard Deggarion's body amidst the ruined remains of his army, the spearhead of Dinatoldir, gleams like sunlight, its metal inlaid with glyphs of old and powerful magic. It is a powerful weapon, and even more powerful of a symbol. What should be done with it?"
 dartaxagerdim_events.6.a:0 "Give it to the Szal-Fazil and let them glean what they can from it."
 dartaxagerdim_events.6.b:0 "Parade it at the head of our armies!"
 dartaxagerdim_events.7.t:0 "The Fate of Kaladora"
 dartaxagerdim_events.7.d:0 "The once Akali of Birzartanšes is brought before you in chains, her eyes cold and betray nothing of her thoughts. Even at the mercy of her greatest enemy and while her city burns, Kaladora shows no remorse or apology for what she has done. It was under her orders that the Jaherian Exemplars scoured the holy sites of the Old Sun Cult forcing conversions at sword-point or giving those who refused to the fire. She cannot be allowed to live for such crimes."
 dartaxagerdim_events.7.a:0 "Burn Her at the Stake."
 dartaxagerdim_events.7.b:0 "She was not alone in her crimes. Let all her nobles and retainers burn as well!"
 dartaxagerdim_events.7.c:0 "There is no such thing as an innocent Elf. Burn them all!"
 dartaxagerdim_events.8.t:0 "The Birzartanšes Administration Policies"
 dartaxagerdim_events.8.d:0 "The Akalate of Birzartanšes was administered with a brutal and clinical precision mainly in part to its expansive bureaucracy and rigorous civil examination system. This system allowed for the documentation and hunting of many Old Sun Cult worshippers but also for the prosperity of the kingdom."
 dartaxagerdim_events.8.a:0 "Utilize the Birzartanši Bureaucracy."
 dartaxagerdim_events.8.b:0 "Burn every trace of this Vile Instrument."
 dartaxagerdim_events.9.t:0 "Ornaments of the Akal"
 dartaxagerdim_events.9.d:0 "The Akal of Baharšes must be garbed as befitting his status, and must represent his people in all ways."
 dartaxagerdim_events.9.a:0 "A worthy sword to bear against the enemies of Baharšes."
 dartaxagerdim_events.9.b:0 "An ornate tapestry depicting our people's storied history."
 dartaxagerdim_events.10.t:0 "The Elven Question"
 dartaxagerdim_events.10.d:0 "Now that Baharšes has finally been once more reunified under a human Akal, it has come time to decide what is to be done with the Sun Elves that still inhabit these lands."
 dartaxagerdim_events.10.a:0 "Though they shall never rule over us again, Man and Elf can live side by side."
 dartaxagerdim_events.10.b:0 "Four centuries of tyranny can only be answered with four centuries of service to Us."
 dartaxagerdim_events.10.c:0 "You do not allow a sickness to fester, a weed to grow. It must pulled out, root and stem!"
 dartaxagerdim_events.11.t:0 "Storming of Irrliam"
 dartaxagerdim_events.11.d:0 "Irrliam burns. The nexus of the heretical New Sun Cult is now purged and cleansed under Surakel's light. The Sun Elf has been cast down from his lofty palace. The architect of such heresy, Telarios, is entombed at the heart of the city, within a vast and gaudy mausoleum."
 dartaxagerdim_events.11.a:0 "Scatter his and all of his kin's ashes into the Suran."
 dartaxagerdim_events.11.b:0 "Telarios is dead. We shall not disturb his rest."
 dartaxagerdim_events.12.t:0 "Desolation of Varamhar"
 dartaxagerdim_events.12.d:0 "The Sun Elf mages proved no match for their human counterparts. Varamahr's walls were torn down, bringing to an end another usurper in Bulwar. Though its mages and priests would be put to the sword, the vast library of knowledge they have curated, however, is innocent of their crimes. There are rumors that circle about that the Elves planned to orchestrate a grand ritual on such a scale of perversity that to call it blasphemous would not be enough. Our mages say they planned to raise one of their own up as a divine, as a god."
 dartaxagerdim_events.12.a:0 "Glean the secrets of the Ulmis Idiqlat with the aid of the Szal-Fazil."
 dartaxagerdim_events.12.b:0 "Burn the heretics and their blasphemous teachings!"

 dartaxagerdim_events.13.b:0 "Burn the heretics and their blasphemous teachings!"
 dartaxagerdim_events.14.t:0 "The Sebhuliam Revolt"
 dartaxagerdim_events.14.d:0 "Our efforts to curtail the Sebhuliam's influence in both our administration and military has been a successful if difficult endeavor. Many of their ministers have been sacked, officers reassigned to minor positions and their missionaries relegated to preaching on the fringe of our kingdom. The Sebhuliam, fearing that the power they have wielded since our kingdom's founding will be stripped from them once and for all, rise in revolt."
 dartaxagerdim_events.14.a:0 "Down with the Rebel!"
 dartaxagerdim_events.15.t:0 "Heir offered to join the Sebhuliam"
 dartaxagerdim_events.15.d:0 "The Sebhuliam have always been a sect shrouded in mystery. The practices of the militan order are unknown to all but the sparse few initiated into their inner ranks. They now offer our heir the chance to join their group."
 dartaxagerdim_events.15.a:0 "Accept the offer. They will make a proper warrior out of them."

 dartaxagerdim_events.18.a:0 "Where has everyone gone?."
 dartaxagerdim_events.19.t:0 "The Lightning Legion Revolt"
 dartaxagerdim_events.19.d:0 "It begins with crack of thunder on the horizon and fiery arcs of lightning snaking across the sky. The World burns and the Legions revolt."
 dartaxagerdim_events.19.a:0 "Ashen Skies!"
 dartaxagerdim_events.20.t:0 "A Man claiming to be God"
 dartaxagerdim_events.20.d:0 "Power Corrupts. Absolute Power Corrupts Absolutely. Then does the Power of a god do to a mortal man? You should have read your lessons. The God Kings all ruled and fell to their own hubris. Now, so will you."
 dartaxagerdim_events.20.a:0 "Something aren't meant for man."

 dartaxagerdim_events.21.a:0 "Welcome Home, Brother."
 dartaxagerdim_events.22.t:0 "The Ash-al-Shaykh"
 dartaxagerdim_events.22.d:0 "The descendants of Harrum szel-Harrumaz rose to become the second family within the Akalate of Dartaxagerdim, serving as the right hand and staunch supporters of the royal family, on account of their shared kinship. The Ash-al-Shaykh as they were collectively known, were the leading religious family within the Akalate and assured the legitimacy of the House of Szal-Forromaz. In addition, as hereditary lords of the Sebhuliam Order, they commanded the absolute loyalty of the thousand of shock troops that made up the Akalate's Armies."
 dartaxagerdim_events.22.a:0 "Integrate the role of the Ash-al-Shaykh into the descendants of Dartaxes."

 dartaxagerdim_events.50.d:0 "A council of Sebhuliam-aligned clerics have found a prominent local noble guilty of heresy, of which the punishment is to be given to the fire, and for his lands to be seized. Many of the noble's allies have come before the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to plead for their intercession on behalf of the condemned. At the same time, representatives of the Sebhuliam have also arrived at the royal palace, urging the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to not interfere the matters of faith."
 dartaxagerdim_events.50.a:0 "The Sebhuliam overstep their bounds. Clear the noble of all charges."
 dartaxagerdim_events.50.b:0 "Our Faith must be kept pure. Heresy cannot be tolerated."


 dartaxagerdim_events.51.t:0 "Sebhuliam Request Land for Stronghold"
 dartaxagerdim_events.51.d:0 "The Sebhuliam have long surived against the attempts of the New Sun Cult's inquistors, the Jaherian Exemplars, through their network of fortifications centered around the Kuzak Mountains. These remote redoubts have endured for decades and have evolved to serve as strongholds and centers of operations for the Sebhuliam as the Akalate has expanded."
 dartaxagerdim_events.51.a:0 "A strong Sebhuliam means a strong Akalate."

 dartax_gnollish_revenge_desc:0 "After the God Kings and before the time of Jaher, Bulwar suffered under the terror and yoke of the Gnollish packs, vast hordes of demon-worshipping monsters that preyed on women and children and brought many under the slaver's lash. They drove many of our kindred from their ancestral homes and even today, over four hundred years later, continue to desecrate Bulwar with their presence. They will be driven out. One and All."

But, many of our brothers and sisters continue to languish under the rule of the Elven Yoke. Irrliam. Sareyand. Varamhar. Elizna. Their continued presence in Bulwar is a blight and curse to the memory of our ancestors.

As the forefront of our armies, their partisans have gained influential positions outside of our military, some even rising to serve as trusted ministers and confidants to the Akal themselves. However, their rivalry with the nobility has only been exacerbated with their rising star and while the nobles have proven their loyalty to us, the Sebhuliam's ambitions may challenge the authority of the Akal himself, which can not be allowed for the stability of the realm. Removing them, however, will be a difficult and costly task."

What's more, while it initially seemed to be a small site, that was only the tip of a massive palace underground complex, apparently once housing hiding genies from Brasan the Emancipator and the human genie-binders he taught. Though we have only reached the precipice, our magi have started carefully dismantling the defensive magic of the place, and learning the long forgotten arts of genie magic along the way."

The house of Szal-Harrumaz, referred to as the Szalmušar, the Blood of the Founder, would command complete control of the state's religious apparatus as well as ensuring the loyalty of the fanatic Sebhuliam."
