kobold_dragon_cult_religion_desc:0 "The Kobold Dragon Cult is a loose collection of dragon-worshipping sects within kobold society. The members of the Kobold Dragon Cult believe that the entire dragon coast is actually in the form of a dragon. The Dragon Cult believes that Tayekan the Blue is responsible for the downfall of the Gnomish Heirarchy and the rise of the kobolds in the Dragon Coast. It is said when the largest hoard of gold in the world is collected at the Dragonheights that the great ancient father of dragons, Malliath himself, will awaken."
