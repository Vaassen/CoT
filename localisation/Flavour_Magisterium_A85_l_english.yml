 flavor_magisterium.1.d:0 "After several years of preparation, we have concentrated enough resources of the nation to mount a large-scale expedition. The goal is simple: To seize the secrets submerged beneath Damenath, salvage what can be salvaged, and discover secrets and relics of a time lost to ash."
 flavor_magisterium.1.a:0 "Launch the operation!"
 
 flavor_magisterium.2.t:0 "Diverging Opinions"
 flavor_magisterium.2.d:0 "With the logistics of the operation put in place, two divergent opinions appeared among the leaders of the expedition.

 flavor_magisterium.3.d:0 "What first looked like a large stone rising to the sky was actually an obelisk of unknown material, marking the location of a partially flooded underpass.

 flavor_magisterium.5.d:0 "Within the marsh itself, there are a myriad of stinky charms, punctuated in the peat that appears as the area is emptied of any form of moisture. The permanent relay of various teams of mages and mowers finally revealed an entire part of the sunken city. Although most of these buildings are unusable or worthless, one of them, strangely well preserved, caught the attention of the expedition, which is now directing all its efforts towards this strange building."

 flavor_magisterium.6.t:0 "Laboratory"
 flavor_magisterium.6.d:0 "We quickly pierced the entrance of this strange, temple-seeming building, and disabled its magic golems. It has turned out to actually be a laboratory, filled with all kinds of curiosities dating from an age well older than anyone here present. With this discovery, the expedition finally comes to an end, allowing the Magisterium to access a whole lot of new knowledge and relics. At first glance, our leading historians suggest that the precursors may have been experimenting on the native Halanni humans?!"

The blast of the explosion destroyed all the preemptive barriers set up, shaving plains and hills, tearing jungle and forest, vitrifying the sand, liquefying the rock. But no matter the means employed, the result is there: The largest Damestear deposit on the planet. Radiant with a twilight glow, and defying the beauty of the most beautiful women in Halann."

 flavor_magisterium.20.t:0 "Gems Excavated"
 flavor_magisterium.20.d:0 "Our wizards were right, and under the Moonmount there was indeed a huge amount of precious stones. Although their purity is not the best, it remains sufficient to ensure income and materials for our projects."

 flavor_magisterium.21.t:0 "Corinite Debate"
 flavor_magisterium.21.d:0 "There is heavy debate among the magisters as to what to do about the recent upheaval of the Regent Court pantheon. Many magisters have come back from Escann after fighting in the Greentide, providing the majority of the support for placing Corin as the successor to Castellos. Other more traditional magisters, many of the same ones that forbid magisters leaving to fight the Greentide in the first place, still believe that Castellos' son Adean should be their next leader.\n\nAfter much deliberation, taking part over multiple days, the council has decided:"

The offer is tempting, and if we refuse it seems the local guilds will instead purchase the city."
 flavor_magisterium.23.a:0 "Let the guilds have it then, I care not."
 flavor_magisterium.23.b:0 "Oldtower belongs to the Vernemen, buy it quick!"
 flavor_magisterium.23.c:0 "We cannot risk any perceived anti-Damerian expansion yet."
 flavor_magisterium.23.e:0 "Aranthil for so cheap? What a bargain!"
 
 
 flavor_magisterium.24.t:0 "Oldtower Purchase Refused!"
 flavor_magisterium.24.d:0 "The Vernemen have responded negatively to our attempt to sell Oldtower to them. No matter, the local guilds stepped up to fill the gap and our funds are already on the way."
 flavor_magisterium.24.a:0 "Very well, Oldtower shall be turned over to the local burghmeister."
 
 flavor_magisterium.25.t:0 "Purchase Accepted"
 flavor_magisterium.25.d:0 "It would seem our recent attempts to sell our enclave has been met with success. The request funds are being delivered as we speak."
 flavor_magisterium.25.a:0 "Good! Invest the proceeds into our capital"
 
 flavor_magisterium.26.t:0 "Aranthil sale refused"
 flavor_magisterium.26.d:0 "The Wexonards have, most surprisingly, refused our generous offer to sell Aranthil."
 flavor_magisterium.26.a:0 "So be it, Aranthil shall have to find it's own path."
 
 flavor_magisterium.27.t:0 "Magesterium Audit"
 flavor_magisterium.27.d:0 "The Magisterium has sought out and received permission from the Emperor to conduct and official audit of all Imperial Realms. Those found to have Reduced Research Regulations in defiance of Magisterium regulations will no doubt face fierce reprimands. We must prepare our country's mages for this upcoming annoyance."
 flavor_magisterium.27.a:0 "Bribe the officials!"
 flavor_magisterium.27.b:0 "Audit passed!"
 flavor_magisterium.27.c:0 "Audit failed!"

 flavor_magisterium.28.t:0 "Imperial Mage Audit"
 flavor_magisterium.28.d:0 "The results of the Imperial Mage Audit has been returned to us. While many countries were found to follow the correct path we have set forth for them, some were circumventing our regulations. Too many. It is clear that we will need to take further measures to ensure Magecraft does not get abused. But for now..." 
 flavor_magisterium.28.a:0 "The audit is complete."
 
 flavor_magisterium.29.t:0 "Decennial Mage Expo"
 flavor_magisterium.29.d:0 "The time has come to organize the Decennial Expo. Shall we prepare the convention grounds?"
 flavor_magisterium.29.a:0 "Yes, let us host the Expo in a years time!"
 flavor_magisterium.29.b:0 "Perhaps not this decade..."
 
 flavor_magisterium.30.t:0 "An Invintation to the Mage Expo"
 flavor_magisterium.30.d:0 "Dear Sir, Ma'am, or Thing, \n You have been cordially invited to this decade's Decennial Grand Mage Expo, hosted by the Magisterium. Please RSVP as soon as possible, as this magnificent event is the envy of the world, and no doubt will be filled to the brim. "
 flavor_magisterium.30.a:0 "We shall sponsor a small exhibition"
 flavor_magisterium.30.b:0 "We shall sponsor a large exhibition"
 flavor_magisterium.30.c:0 "I shall go myself!"
 flavor_magisterium.30.e:0 "Send our heir!"
 flavor_magisterium.30.f:0 "Send our general!"
 flavor_magisterium.30.g:0 "No, we can neither afford nor trust this."
 
 flavor_magisterium.31.t:0 "While at the Expo..."
 flavor_magisterium.31.d:0 "While touring the exhibitions at the Expo, a Mage of the Collegium politely interrupts your reverie. Their calm, diplomatic manner makes clear they have intentions beyond mere conversation. Sure enough, they end their admittedly learned remarks on your latest demonstartion of magic with a unique proposal..."
 flavor_magisterium.31.a:0 "Let us align with these mages in all things."
 flavor_magisterium.31.b:0 "Align with the magisterium."
 flavor_magisterium.31.c:0 "Let us officially embrace the cult of the dame."
 flavor_magisterium.31.e:0 "We shall keep our sovereignity."
 
 flavor_magisterium.32.t:0 "The Expo is Ended"
 flavor_magisterium.32.d:0 "The last of the attendees have left our shores and the Expo has officially concluded. Their eagerness to show the best of their magics have proven quite valuable in both boosting our institution's prestige and our military's curriculum."
 flavor_magisterium.32.a:0 "We learned quite a bit."
 
 flavor_magisterium.33.t:0 "Imperial Ban on the Gnomo"
 flavor_magisterium.33.d:0 "Wielding their great influence over the Emperor, the Magisterium has managed once and for all to ban the institution of the Gnomo from the Empire. It is now clear that the princes of the Empire can no longer stay quiet. We must choose."
 flavor_magisterium.33.a:0 "Artificers over Empire! (Leave Empire)."
 flavor_magisterium.33.b:0 "So be it. Uphold the artificer ban."
 flavor_magisterium.33.c:0 "Always for the mages!"
 
 flavor_magisterium.34.t:0 "Mages Convene for the Dame"
 flavor_magisterium.34.d:0 "Recently the Magisterium has subsumed the Church of the Dame, Patron goddess of Magic, and declared themselves the stewards of the Faith. To this end, they have called all Cannorian mages to the Collegium to discuss the faith. It is clear that the cult of the Dame will soon be flourishing, and the more who join it's ranks no doubt the stronger it shall become."
 flavor_magisterium.34.a:0 "Let us send a representative!"
 flavor_magisterium.34.b:0 "How quaint, the Mages think we care."
 
 flavor_magisterium.35.t:0 "Another joins the cult!"
 flavor_magisterium.35.d:0 "Praise be, another nation has joined the cult of the Dame!"
 flavor_magisterium.35.a:0 "Ave Madre"
 
 flavor_magisterium.36.t:0 "Meet with Khetarch"
 flavor_magisterium.36.d:0 "It is no secret we seek to expand our influence... rather save the faithless in sarhal and bulwar. The Khetarch have long held sway in Kheterata, and claim to be."
 flavor_magisterium.36.a:0 "Let's see if these cats can purr."
 flavor_magisterium.36.b:0 "Why bother with those Zealots?"
 
 flavor_magisterium.37.t:0 "A Meeting with the Magisterium?"
 flavor_magisterium.37.d:0 "Quite curiously, the Mages of the Magisterium have asked to meet with the Khetarch... apparently to discuss matters of religion. We do not know what they want, but it's unlikely they wish to convert to the one true faith."
 flavor_magisterium.37.a:0 "The Magisterium? Curious, arrange the meeting."
 flavor_magisterium.37.b:0 "Those upstarts think they are worth the honor? Send them away!"
 
 flavor_magisterium.38.t:0 "Relations Ended"
 flavor_magisterium.38.d:0 "After a significant waiting period, it has become clear that we are getting nowhere with these Khetists. Best we retire this endeavor now."
 flavor_magisterium.38.a:0 "It seems the cats know only how to nap."
 
 flavor_magisterium.39.t:0 "Meeting allowed"
 flavor_magisterium.39.d:0 "Incredible news! The Khetists have actually agreed to allow our delegation to meet with the Khetarch. This is a once in a millennium opportunity that we cannot pass up. We must instruct our delegation most carefully... if we can convince the Khetarch to some sort of deal, with just a few words we can extend our loving guidance to a large portion of people at once!"
 flavor_magisterium.39.a:0 "Delegation? This is too important I'll go myself!"
 flavor_magisterium.39.b:0 "Send a head of one of the colleges."
 flavor_magisterium.39.c:0 "Let's use the head of the college of Enchantment..."
 flavor_magisterium.39.e:0 "Send a skilled diplomat."
 
 flavor_magisterium.40.t:0 "The Meeting with the Mages."
 flavor_magisterium.40.d:0 "The time has come for the meeting with the mages. They have clearly prepared well for this meeting, and follow our etiquette perfectly. They bring with them a mountain of books, scrolls, and tablets, and launch into a most curious lineage mapping of the different Khets and the Cannorian so-called deities. The geneology, and all it's various theories, take more than an hour to complete, with the Cannorian Pantheon and the Khetist lineages all tracing back to Castellos and the Elikhet respectively. This is where things comes to a head. \n \n Taking a deep breath, the head delegate bows, saying 'When it comes to Castellos, and the Elikhet, the lineage is unclear. From our studies we have found two likely conclusions, Your Grand Eminence.' You lift a fur-lined digit in acknowledgement. \n \n 'Thank you, O Great One.' The delegate turns and reverently taps the papyros where it is marked 'Castellos', then continues speaking. The first theory we have is that Castellos is perhaps a child of the Elikhet and the Dame. The second theory is that...' the delagate pauses, taking another deep breath, 'That Castellos and the Elikhet are one and the same, and that the Dame is his mother, whom some in this land refer to as Nirakhet.' \n \n A hush falls across the small audience in the room. Nirakhet. The mother of the Elikhet. Such teachings, though wildly believed among the populace, is nonetheless considered heresy by the orthodox of the faith. To acknowledge the existence of the Nirakhet is to drive a schism between the priests and the commonfolk, and should not be done lightly. With eyes squinting, you consider the Delegate's words as he continues. 'If we can reconcile the theology, our peoples will both be better able to help administer the souls of our people. I would like to explain at this time to the more pragmatic benefits...' \n \n As the mortal continues on, you devote a portion of your mind to what was uttered. Could the Elikhet and Castellos truly be the same being? Is the ludicrious proposal that the Dame is the Nirakhet, that the Nirakhet truly existed, something worth considering? Eventually, the small mortal figure before you finishes speaking, and you are left to decide."
 flavor_magisterium.40.a:0 "Ignorant heathen, you dare utter that name!? Begone!"
 flavor_magisterium.40.b:0 "Humorous. You may leave now."
 flavor_magisterium.40.c:0 "It is clear: this 'Dame' was a mortal the Elikhet mated with once, her spawn are not Khet."
 flavor_magisterium.40.e:0 "This 'Dame' was surely a lost wife of the Elikhet, and Castellos a lesser child."
 flavor_magisterium.40.f:0 "It is time for new truths. Nirakhet is real, and her child is Castellos, the Elikhet."
 
 flavor_magisterium.41.t:0 "Our Delegation Returns"
 flavor_magisterium.41.d:0 "Our delegation the meet with the Khetarch has returned. Quickly, let us see what news they bring!"
 flavor_magisterium.41.a:0 "Well, at least they didn't kill everyone."
 flavor_magisterium.41.b:0 "They called the Dame a what?"
 flavor_magisterium.41.c:0 "The Dame and the Elikhet sired Castellos, eh? I'll... be in my study."
 flavor_magisterium.41.e:0 "Proclaim it to the world - Our mistress is the Nirakhet!"
 
 flavor_magisterium.42.t:0 "Ultimatum to the Ravelians"
 flavor_magisterium.42.d:0 "The Magisterium and their cronies have sent us an ultimatum. Supposedly they can 'no longer tolerate our many slights against the true faith', which is code of course for 'Ravelians make too much money and are us mages are too scared to let you live'. It is time for the showdown for the soul of Halann; will we submit to their pitiful demands, or will we show them there is a better path."
 flavor_magisterium.42.a:0 "They will learn of the secrets of the Cube"
 flavor_magisterium.42.b:0 "Actually I think the voices are fading..."
 
 flavor_magisterium.43.t:0 "A Reply from the Ravelians"
 flavor_magisterium.43.d:0 "The Ravelian dogs have finally sent their reply. Took those sanity-deprived muling pukes long enough. Their response: predictable, their use of vulgar language: trite and boring."
 flavor_magisterium.43.a:0 "War it is then!"
 flavor_magisterium.43.b:0 "Good, cowards should submit."
 flavor_magisterium.43.c:0 "Ha, I'm surprised there were any left."
