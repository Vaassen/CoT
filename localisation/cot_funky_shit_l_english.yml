 V01_4:0 "Olavish Stratocracy"
 V01_4_desc:0 "While the Reachmen compose a significant number of our population, their service in our kingdom will be relegated to aiding us in an economic fashion.

 V01_5:0 "Black-Flag Marines"
 V01_5_desc:0 "A Gerudian finds fighting on sea as natural as if it were fighting on land. A sea-faring people, young Gerudians spend as much time on longships as they on solid ground. This has allowed us to carry our martial prowess to the waves and distant shores."

The goblins, of course, are most adept to using this style due to their small size. Though many conservatives in the Xia call it cowardly, it is hard to admit it isn't effective."
 V02_2:0 "The Misty Mountains"
 V02_2_desc:0 "Ever since the introduction of martial arts to the Serpentspine Goblins, many began to nickname the Jademines the "misty mountains".

 V02_5:0 "The Trial of the Cave"
 V02_5_desc:0 "With the reformation of the goblin army in Ozhkredu, a new trial for all who wished to go into the army was implemented.

 V02_6:0 "Cavern's of Enlightenment"
 V02_6_desc:0 "Many goblins, on the way to enlightenment looked at the caves of the Serpentspine to aid them. In the caves, the goblins would practice a very simple lifestyle, and would stay there for a few months to a few years.
