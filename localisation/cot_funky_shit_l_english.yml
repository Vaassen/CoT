 V01_5:0 "Black-Flag Marines"
 V01_5_desc:0 "A Gerudian finds fighting on sea as natural as if it were fighting on land. A sea-faring people, young Gerudians spend as much time on longships as they on solid ground. This has allowed us to carry our martial prowess to the waves and distant shores."

 V02_2:0 "The Misty Mountains"
 V02_2_desc:0 "Ever since the introduction of martial arts to the Serpentspine Goblins, many began to nickname the Jademines the "misty mountains".

 V02_6:0 "Cavern's of Enlightenment"
 V02_6_desc:0 "Many goblins, on the way to enlightenment looked at the caves of the Serpentspine to aid them. In the caves, the goblins would practice a very simple lifestyle, and would stay there for a few months to a few years.
