 CoT_ourdi_census_events.2.d:0 "As the [Root.GetAdjective] court fills with state officials, [Root.Monarch.GetName] starts to wonder how much to invest in the next census, or whether to do one at all. The master recruiter advises to hire extra bureaucrats for the task and carry out an exhaustive census to maximize the amount of able-bodied men ready to draft. However the treasurer advises to carry out a more conservative census, arguing the possible extra tax revenues aren't worth the cost of extra censors."

 CoT_ourdi_census_events.3.d:0 "As the last censor closes the door of the room after leaving, [Root.Monarch.GetName] finds [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] relieved. Another decade, another census. A pile of endless reports now lies in the desk; births, deaths, young men coming to arm-bearing age, new farm animals and workshops to tax, etc.\n\nTax and debt collectors have been put up to date. Recruiters and lesser nobles have been sent a list of young able-bodied men. The court advisors rejoice in all the new young recruits and tax revenue this updated census will bring."
