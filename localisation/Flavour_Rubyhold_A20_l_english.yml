 #CoT Events
 
 flavor_rubyhold.1.t:0 "Lorentish Pressure"
 flavor_rubyhold.1.d:0 "As the culmination of months of extremely overt attempts to sway our nation to their cause, a Lorentish diplomat has arrived during the hour of drinking today. It is clear from the large entourage of Knights that this is to be the culmination of their efforts. The diplomat made clear that the Lorentish Monarchs view our hold as strategically important, and have -politely as per their infuriatingly opaque ways- asked that we give some sign of our stance on their nation. They stopped well clear of outright demanding our fealty, but any right-minded Dawi can see it is what they desire. We could, of course, circumvent this by joining the Empire. What shall our reply be?"
 flavor_rubyhold.1.a:0 "We built Lorent, now they can be our wall. §RThis choice may lead to war with Wesdam§!"
 flavor_rubyhold.1.b:0 "We shall pay for protection, but we cleave to a dwarf's throne."
 flavor_rubyhold.1.c:0 "Their concern is flattering."
 flavor_rubyhold.1.e:0 "§RTHEY WHAT?! SUMMON THE LADS, IT'S CLEAR OUR DOG NEEDS LEASHING!§!"
 flavor_rubyhold.1.f:0 "Better a Prince than a Pawn."
 
 flavor_rubyhold.2.t:0 "Rubyhold Asks To Enter the Empire"
 flavor_rubyhold.2.d:0 "We've just learned that the Dwarves of Rubyhold have surprised our consulate not long ago with a plea to enter the Empire of Anbennar, in order to counter rising Lorentish influence in their realm. This provides us with a unique opportunity to gain a strong ally in western Anbennar... however our enmity towards Silverforge is no secret and many will see this move as an attempt to supplant them; of course supplanting those Moon-lovers is an appealing thought."
 flavor_rubyhold.2.a:0 "Let the Ruby Dwarves in!"
 flavor_rubyhold.2.b:0 "No, we cannot upset the balance just yet."
 
 flavor_rubyhold.3.t:0 "The Imperial Response"
 flavor_rubyhold.3.d:0 "The Emperor has responded to our request to join the Empire of Anbennar and..."
 flavor_rubyhold.3.a:0 "We have been welcomed with open arms."
 flavor_rubyhold.3.b:0 "Sadly, no. They claimed something about political balance... typical humans."
